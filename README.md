# BASIC-CHATBOT

This Python project is a simple rule-based chatbot that interacts with users using basic conversation logic. When the user types messages like “hello,” “how are you,” or “bye,” the chatbot responds with predefined replies. It uses if-elif conditions inside a loop to keep the conversation going until the user says “bye.” If the input doesn’t match any known phrase, the bot replies that it didn’t understand. This project helped me understand how to handle user input, use functions, loops, and apply logic flow in real-time conversation. It’s a fun way to learn programming basics interactively!
